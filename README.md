# üß≠ Product Paging Demo ‚Äî Jetpack Compose + Paging 3

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an **infinite scrolling product list** using **Jetpack Compose**, **Paging 3**, and **Retrofit**.  
It uses the public [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) and focuses on mastering **PagingSource**, **Pager**, and **LoadState handling**.

This project is designed as a **learning sandbox** ‚Äî starting with a **remote-only paging setup**, then later upgraded to a **Room + RemoteMediator** architecture.

- Understand **how Paging 3 fetches and presents data**.
- Learn how to **connect Pager ‚Üí Flow ‚Üí LazyPagingItems** in Compose.
- Handle **load states** for loading, error, and empty UI.
- Avoid common pitfalls like Pager recreation and key reuse.
